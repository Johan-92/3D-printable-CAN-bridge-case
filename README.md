CAN bridge case for Dala's EV Repair variant of the CAN bridge.
This CAN bridge case only works for the PCB that is the size of 32*59 mm.

Always print with support for the USB opening on the side.

-If CAN bridge is meant to be used for data logging, print case with USB cover included, remove support from USB opening and use USB cover when not used.

-If CAN bridge is not meant for data logging, print case without USB cover, and leave the support material in the USB opening. If data logging later is needed, just print the USB cover.
